# 5.10 Create Page Wizard

![](../assets/wizardicon.png)

The **Create Page Wizard** provides a set of tools to assist in creating a new wiki page. Look for the wizard wand icon in the page information area when you first enter the editor with a new page name.

The administrator can also make the New Page **block** enter the Create Page Wizard instead of the Editor.
The wizard will present a series of panels, each with Continue and Cancel options.

If no page name has been specified, the first panel will display a selection list of namespaces the user has permissions for, and a text field for entry of a page name.

The next panel shows the available options to create a page:
- **Create from Template** - If a Template Namespace is defined, a list of all available templates will be shown. The Content portion of the selected template page will be copied into a the new page.
- **Copy an existing page** - enter the page name of an existing page. The entire page, including most data from the Meta Edit section in the page editor, will be copied to the new page.
- **Import from HTML** - Select an HTML file, or copy and paste the HTML into the form. The conversion is limited, and simpler documents work better.
- **Import a Text file** - Copy a text file into a wiki page. This can be used to import pages from another wiki, or to load a text file to be reformatted as a wiki page.
- **Create an Image Gallery** - select a set of images and create a gallery page from them.
