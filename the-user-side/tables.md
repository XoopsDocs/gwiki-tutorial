# Tables

Tables cells are enclosed in vertical bars. `|cell|`

|  |
| --- |
| cell |

The alignment and formatting in a cell can be modified with a format character following its opening bar. An "=" makes it a header cell, a "&gt;" right aligns the content, a "&lt;" left aligns it and a "+" centers it. The spaces and bar alignments in the following example are to help readability only; they are not required.
